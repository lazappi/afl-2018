Introduction
============

The `aflelo` package contains functions for optimising parameters of the Elo
model using a genetic algorithm. In this document we are going to look at the
results of running this optimisation. There two thing we can try to optimise
for: the error in predicting the margin of games or the percentage of games
where the winner has been correctly predicted. I have run the optimisation three
times, once aiming for the minimum margin error, once aiming for the greatest
win percentage and once with a 50/50 balance between the two. Let's have a look
at the different parameters that have been selected and compare their
performance to the default parameters, based on those used by The Arc.

Parameters
==========

Let's read in the results of the optimisaion and have a look at the best
performing sets of parameters.

```{r load-opt}
opt_mar <- read_rds(here("data/opt_margin.Rds")) %>%
    bind_rows() %>%
    mutate(Generation = rep(1:100, each = 100)) %>%
    arrange(-Fitness)

opt_bal <- read_rds(here("data/opt_balanced.Rds")) %>%
    bind_rows() %>%
    mutate(Generation = rep(1:100, each = 100)) %>%
    arrange(-Fitness)

opt_win <- read_rds(here("data/opt_prediction.Rds")) %>%
    bind_rows() %>%
    mutate(Generation = rep(1:100, each = 100)) %>%
    arrange(-Fitness)

opt_summ <- bind_rows(unlist(aflelo_params()),
                      opt_mar[1, ], opt_bal[1, ], opt_win[1, ]) %>%
    data.frame() %>%
    mutate(Version = c("Default", "Margin", "Balanced", "Prediction")) %>%
    select(Version, new_team_rating, new_season_adjustment, hga_alpha, hga_beta,
           pred_p, adjust_k_early, adjust_k_normal, adjust_k_finals)

opt_summ
```

There are some significant differences here compared to the defaults, although
interestingly the Margin and Balanced parameters have a lot of similarities to
each other. To decide which to use for the model we need to look at how they
have performed.

Performance
===========

The parameters were optimised using games from the 1997 to 2016 seasons with
the 2000 onwards used to calculate fitness. This means we can look at the
performance of the parameter sets on this set of games but also the 2017 season
which was not used for the optimisation in any way.

```{r setup-pop}
pop <- list(Default = aflelo_params(),
            Margin = aflelo_params(
                new_team_rating       = opt_summ[2, ]$new_team_rating,
                new_season_adjustment = opt_summ[2, ]$new_season_adjustment,
                hga_alpha             = opt_summ[2, ]$hga_alpha,
                hga_beta              = opt_summ[2, ]$hga_beta,
                pred_p                = opt_summ[2, ]$pred_p,
                adjust_k_early        = opt_summ[2, ]$adjust_k_early,
                adjust_k_normal       = opt_summ[2, ]$adjust_k_normal,
                adjust_k_finals       = opt_summ[2, ]$adjust_k_finals 
            ),
            Balanced = aflelo_params(
                new_team_rating       = opt_summ[3, ]$new_team_rating,
                new_season_adjustment = opt_summ[3, ]$new_season_adjustment,
                hga_alpha             = opt_summ[3, ]$hga_alpha,
                hga_beta              = opt_summ[3, ]$hga_beta,
                pred_p                = opt_summ[3, ]$pred_p,
                adjust_k_early        = opt_summ[3, ]$adjust_k_early,
                adjust_k_normal       = opt_summ[3, ]$adjust_k_normal,
                adjust_k_finals       = opt_summ[3, ]$adjust_k_finals 
            ),
            Prediction = aflelo_params(
                new_team_rating       = opt_summ[4, ]$new_team_rating,
                new_season_adjustment = opt_summ[4, ]$new_season_adjustment,
                hga_alpha             = opt_summ[4, ]$hga_alpha,
                hga_beta              = opt_summ[4, ]$hga_beta,
                pred_p                = opt_summ[4, ]$pred_p,
                adjust_k_early        = opt_summ[4, ]$adjust_k_early,
                adjust_k_normal       = opt_summ[4, ]$adjust_k_normal,
                adjust_k_finals       = opt_summ[4, ]$adjust_k_finals 
            ))
```

```{r eval-2016, cache = TRUE}
data("matches")
matches2016 <- filter(matches, Season <= 2016)

eval_2016 <- evaluate_population(pop, matches2016, n_cores = 5)
```

```{r eval-2017, cache = TRUE}
eval_2017 <- evaluate_population(pop, matches, start_eval = 2017,
                                 end_eval = 2017, n_cores = 5)
```

```{r eval-summ}
opt_summ <- opt_summ %>%
    mutate(Margin2016 = eval_2016$MarginMAE,
           Predict2016 = eval_2016$PctCorrect) %>%
    mutate(Margin2017 = eval_2017$MarginMAE,
           Predict2017 = eval_2017$PctCorrect)

opt_summ
```

Based on the 2017 results I'm going to use the Margin model. Despite being
optimised for margin accuracy it also performs best on 2017 prediction. This
might suggest that the optimisation procedure is not ideal, but that is a
problem for another day... Encouragingly all three of my models outperform
the defaults, which suggests that the results will be some where in the range
of the The Arc, and I am more than happy with that.

To finish up let's train a model that we can use to make predictions about the
2018 season!

Model
=====

```{r train-model, cache = TRUE}
params <- pop$Margin
model <- aflelo_model(params)
model <- train_model(model, matches)
```

So at the end of the 2017 season we have the following ratings:

```{r ratings}
model$ratings %>% arrange(desc(Rating))
```

Interestingly Sydney comes up top and GWS is probably a bit lower down than you
would expect. Here is the laddder at the end of the home and away games for
comparison:

```{r ladder}
model$ladder %>% arrange(desc(Points))
```

Session info
============

```{r session-info, cache = FALSE}
devtools::session_info()
```

```{r cleanup-docs, cache = FALSE}
doc.files <- c(list.files(pattern = "pdf"),
               list.files(pattern = "html"),
               list.files(pattern = "docx"))

for (file in doc.files) {
    file.rename(file, file.path("../docs", file))
}
```
